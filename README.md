Online Food Delivery Application

Detailed Project Description
The Online Food Delivery Application is a robust and scalable web-based project developed using a combination of Core and Advanced Java technologies, with a focus on clean architecture and modularity. It integrates various frameworks and tools for efficient development, deployment, and database management.
Technologies and Tools Used

    Backend Development
        Core Java: Implements the core logic of the application.
        DAO (Data Access Object) Design Pattern: Ensures separation of database-related logic from business logic, promoting maintainability and reusability.
        MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture: Organizes code into logical layers:
            Model: Encapsulates business logic and data.
            View: Provides JSP pages for a user-friendly interface.
            Controller: Manages application flow via Servlets.
        JDBC with MySQL Connector (mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar): Facilitates interaction with the MySQL database.

    Frontend Development
        JSP (JavaServer Pages): Handles the dynamic content for the user interface.
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Implements styling and interactivity (e.g., styles.css file).

    Database
        MySQL: Stores user data, menu items, orders, and cart details.

    Server
        Apache Tomcat: Hosts the application, enabling browser access.

    Project Configuration
        Maven (pom.xml): Manages dependencies and builds the project.
        Deployment Descriptor (web.xml): Configures application deployment details.
